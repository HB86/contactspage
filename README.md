My contacts application is designed to store my personal and business contacts and help me organize them in a more effective way to keep  without using data on my phone. 

Prerequisites
The user will to access the application on a Windows operating system. To open and run my windows form application, the user will click on the icon of the application to open it. 

How to Use
Once the application is open, the user can create a new contact. 
To add a new contact, simply type the contact information into the First Name, Last Name, Phone Number and Email fields.
Next click on the "Save New Contact" Button. 
Only the First Name field is reqired to save a new contact but more is prefererd. 
Once the contact has been added, you will then see the new contact displayed in the datagrid at the bottom of the form. 

Future planned releases
Coming in VNext will be the delete function and search saved contacts function.
